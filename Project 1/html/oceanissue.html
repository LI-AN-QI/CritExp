            <p id="fact1">Balloon manufacturers usually state that latex balloons are completely<br> 
                safe to release into the environment because they are made of natural <br>   
                substances and will degrade over time.<br> 
                <br/>
               While latex is technically biodegradable, in the marine environment<br> 
               it takes between six months and four years to break down completely,<br>  
               this periods of time is long enough to pose significant threats. </p>

            <p id="risk1_des">On Sept. 27, 1986, approximately 1.5 million balloons were released 
                into the air above the city of Cleveland in an attempt to break a 
                Guinness World Record.<br/><br>
                However, the released balloons drifted back over the city and Lake 
                Erie and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for 
                traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a 
                United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later
                found drowned.</p>

            <p id="risk2_des1">The Ocean Conservancy's annual International Coastal
                Cleanup reports that from 2008 to 2016 almost 300,000
                balloons were found along U.S. beaches.</p>
            <p id="risk2_des2">Deflated weather balloons were likely a principal
                threat to marine life due to the resemblance of
                shredded latex to jellyfish or squid, which are 
                important prey for many marine life. </p>

            <p id="risk3_des">In 2014, a critically endangered sea turtle was found dead 
                on Fisherman Island, Virginia with two latex balloons lodged
                 in its gastrointestinal tract. Protruding from its 
                mouth was a plastic ribbon attached to one of the balloons. 
                The second latex balloon was found lower in the 
                gastrointestinal tract.</p>

            <p id="risk4_des1">You may intuitively think about the impact on the wildlife and the environment, 
                but ironically, weather stations launch weather balloons on a daily basis to attain critical 
                data for cour weather forecasts. 
                <br><br/> 
                While they are not launching hundreds at a time, across the globe between 900 to 1300 locations do routine releases
                of two or four times daily, which means only one weather station will launch over 700 balloons every year.</p>
            
            <p id="risk4_des2"> 
                Most of these released meteorological balloons are 
                not tracked or recovered, including their associated detection equipment.<br><br/>

                About 20% of the 78,000 radiosondes launched 
                annually are found and mailed back, where they are 
                refurbished and reused.

                This is a shredded weather balloon collected by researchers from North Queensland.
                It still attached to the radio-reactive target RRT.
